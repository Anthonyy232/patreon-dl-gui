## Connect to YouTube account

---

This option is only available when you choose to use the built-in downloader for downloading embedded YouTube videos.

`patreon-dl` supports downloading embedded YouTube videos or from embedded YouTube video links. In addition, if you have a YouTube Premium subscription, you can connect `patreon-dl` to your account and download videos at qualities available only to Premium accounts (e.g. "1080p Premium").

To connect to your YouTube account, open the YouTube Configurator through clicking the cogs icon button or choosing from the Run menu. This option has no effect if you are not connected.
