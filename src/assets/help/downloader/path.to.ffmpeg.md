## Path to FFmpeg

---

The path to [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org) executable.

FFmpeg is required when downloading:

- videos that are provided only in streaming format; and
- embedded YouTube videos using the built-in downloader.

  <span class="material-icons text-info me-1 fs-5">info</span>
  Not all video downloads require FFmpeg, but you should have it installed on your system anyway.
</div>

If not specified, `ffmpeg` will be called directly when needed, so it should be in the PATH.
