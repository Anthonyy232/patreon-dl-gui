## Use status cache

---

If enabled, `patreon-dl` creates a file that keeps track of items that have been downloaded. In subsequent downloads, the status cache is used to quickly determine whether an item previously downloaded has changed and can thus be skipped.

<div class="d-inline-flex align-items-center border border-3 border-top-0 border-end-0 border-bottom-0 border-warning px-2 py-1 mb-4">
  <span class="material-icons text-warning me-2 fs-5">warning</span>
  If you modify or delete any downloaded file, the status cache will be unaware of it!
</div>
